# HoverFill

HoverFill is a component that displays a button with a light hover effect.

HoverFill will show background based on the hover origin.

## As a light button

HoverFill can be used as a light button:

<LightButton />

## As a light card

HoverFill can be used as a light card:

<LightCard />

## Multiple HoverFills

When HoverFills are near each other and share the same parent, they will **automatically** share one background when you hover from one to another.

Make sure not to set `overflow: hidden` on the parent element.

<Multiple />
