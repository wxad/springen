# HoverFill

HoverFill is a component that displays a light background when hovering on it.

HoverFill will show background based on the hover origin.

## As a Light Button

HoverFill can be used as a light button:

<LightButton />

## As a Light Card

HoverFill can be used as a light card:

<LightCard />

## Siblings Share Background

When HoverFills share the same parent as siblings, they will **automatically** share one background when you hover from one to another.

Make sure not to set `overflow: hidden` on the parent element, otherwise don't use this component.
