# About Springen

## Background

I've been struggling with the design language in our business.

When I want to refine it properly, I find myself torn between modifying individual components one by one or starting a full redesign of the entire design language.

For now, I’ve taken a middle-ground approach — I tend to use a verb to encapsulate certain components with similar behaviors, and that’s where 'Springen' comes from (it means 'jump' in German).

I’m not deliberately using another foreign language, it’s just that registering a unique npm package is really challenging.

Similarly, I created another library called [Spross](https://wxad.design/spross).

So springen, as a design system concept, describes lightweight, contextually triggered components that provide smooth navigation when transitioning.

## Purpose

Of course, I don’t want to create components that feel outdated. I want each repetition to at least be infused with new creativity. Therefore, they should either have interesting features or be a result of my rethinking of best practices.
