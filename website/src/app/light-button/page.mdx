# LightButton

LightButton is a component that displays a button with a light hover effect.

## Hover Origin Aware

LightButton will show background based on the hover origin:

<Basics />

## Multiple Buttons

When LightButtons are near each other and share the same parent, they will **automatically** share one background when you hover from one to another:

<Multiple />
